> They are collectively known as the “Air Force” lists. ... The first contains all single words from NI2; the second, all compound forms. Not every word in NI2 is here; not every word here is in NI2. The correspondence is very close for web2, but not so good for web2a–there are many NI2 compound entries missing from web2a. In addition, there are many inflected forms missing from these lists. However, for NPL purposes these two lists are invaluable since they cover the largest current reference very well. These lists are mixed case.
