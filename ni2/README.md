The two NI2 word lists are known as “web2” and “web2a”, and have both been widely available for a long time. They are collectively known as the “Air Force” lists. You may be interested in [information](http://wiki.puzzlers.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=solving:wordlists:about:mcilroy) we received from [Doug McIlroy](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/) about the origin of both these lists and the Unix dictionary. The first contains all single words from NI2; the second, all compound forms. Not every word in NI2 is here; not every word here is in NI2. The correspondence is very close for web2, but not so good for web2a–there are many NI2 compound entries missing from web2a. In addition, there are many inflected forms missing from these lists. However, for NPL purposes these two lists are invaluable since they cover the largest current reference very well.

These lists are mixed case.

Single words – 234,936 entries
Compound forms – 76, 205 entries
